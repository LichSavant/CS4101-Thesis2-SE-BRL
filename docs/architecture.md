Gmail DOM assumptions are confined to `gmailSelectors.ts` and `GmailEmailSourceAdapter`. The popup, service worker, API client, and backend receive typed metadata and do not know Gmail selectors. Mock mode follows the same contracts and remains the automated-test default.

## Duplicate prevention

The content script debounces mutations by 600 ms and tracks each visible message ID once until another message is selected. FastAPI separately ignores the same user/message `email_open` within five seconds. Reopening later remains countable.

## Analysis pipeline

`Analyzer` currently resolves to `RuleBasedAnalyzer`. `/api/v1/analyze-email` accepts schema version `1.0` and returns behaviors, recommendation, risk, classification, and `modelVersion: null`. Future BRL, text/URL feature extractors, ML classifier, and explanation generator should be introduced behind this boundary. Rule-based results must never be called ML predictions.

See [gmail-integration.md](gmail-integration.md) for operational limitations.

## SE-BRL API contract boundary

The backend includes a strict, frozen Pydantic representation of the existing
SE-BRL structural result envelope and a domain-to-Pydantic adapter. The adapter
accepts only an immutable `ml.se_brl.ResultEnvelope`, uses the domain serializer,
and revalidates versions, canonical ordering, statuses, and cross-field
compatibility at the backend boundary.

`GET /api/v1/se-brl/status` exposes this internal fail-closed SE-BRL foundation.
For the content-bearing email workflow, it currently returns only
`not_evaluated`. This is a readiness/status boundary, not a phishing-analysis
endpoint. The existing `/api/v1/analyze-email` endpoint remains rule-based and
separate.

## Internal SE-BRL orchestration

An internal backend service sits between future FastAPI routing and the existing
domain-to-Pydantic adapter. It constructs only `not_evaluated`,
`review_required`, and `failed` responses with canonical identifiers and fixed,
non-sensitive limitations. No completed analytical path exists.

The internal [pre-training analytical pipeline](se-brl-pretraining.md) now adds
artifact preprocessing, conventional fit/transform feature interfaces, versioned
candidate indicator rules, evidence locators, BRL placeholders, E1/E2/E3 feature
boundaries, and future classifier/trainer interfaces. It reuses the codebook,
assessment resolver, and fail-closed envelope without changing the existing API.

Canonical dataset adapter records now preserve provenance outside the API envelope
and keep phishing source labels separate from behavioral annotations. Supplied
group metadata can be checked against existing split manifests. Evidence-aware
trust detectors require independent references; versioned feature configuration
manifests, sparse-compatible feature storage, and an internal readiness report
prepare the dataset phase without training or generating learned outputs.

Dataset audits, validated behavioral models, calibration, thresholds, completed
outputs, extension integration, and dashboard integration remain deferred.
Rule evidence is neither learned behavioral probability nor final phishing
probability. The SE-BRL model is not complete.
